	<h1> What Happened to Front License Plates? </h1>
</div>

<div class="body">

	<p>The United States has patchwork traffic laws: 29 states currently legally require both front and rear license plates on passenger vehicles. In the rest, the front one is optional.</p> 

	<img src="Map.png" width="800px" height="500px">	

	<p>But enforcement is lax across the board. Police rarely bother to write out tickets solely for missing front plates.</p> 

	<p>In New York, unmarked bumpers have become almost as common as jaywalkers. The more murderous or Musk-adjacent the vehicle, the likelier it is to be anonymous up front.</p> 

	<p>Pretty much the only countries outside North America that don’t require front plates are in Micronesia. But in the US, even this seemingly inconsequential issue had become a political flashpoint.</p> 

	<p>So what are the arguments?</p>

				<p><h4> Front license plates are unnecessary.</h4></p>
				<p> The rear plate is more important in most cases that require vehicle identification, such as police chases or hit-and-runs. However, there are many scenarios where an absence of front plates might lead to a violator getting away. Most highway toll systems, speed traps and automatic parking areas also rely on scanning front plates.  </p>

				<p><h4>Front license plates are ugly and damage cars.</h4></p>
				<p> It is true that mounting a front plate typically requires drilling into the car’s bumper. Many car dealerships nowadays don’t do this unless a customer asks for it. Sure, a car looks more pure and streamlined sans plate. But following this logic of aesthetic decluttering, one might as well get rid of side mirrors or windshield wipers next.</p>

				<p><h4>No front plates reduce the workload for the inmates that make them.</h4></p>
				<p>Yes – the vast majority of license plates in the US are manufactured in prisons. However, the time-consuming part of making a license plate is to arrange the digits manually on the machine. Tamping one or two plates is a difference of seconds.</p>

				<p><h4>Front license plates are a sign of government overreach.</h4></p>
				<p>Nowhere else in the world have people even had the thought that they would like to choose where they put their license plates. How can the government overreach on an issue most people do not even recognise as an issue?</p>

				<p><h4>Front license plates are only used by coastal liberals.</h4></p>
				<p>This may nowadays be true. It has become general knowledge that anybody driving across the country should remove their front plate if they want to avoid getting their car tampered with, or landing in trouble with police.</p>

				<p><h4>Freedom to do as one pleases is what American freedom is about. </h4></p>
				<p>Cowboys in the Wild West and their car-riding descendants probably didn’t care to have two license plates, if they bothered with any at all. Yet staking American civil liberties on a license plate ought to raise alarm over the health of said liberties.</p>
